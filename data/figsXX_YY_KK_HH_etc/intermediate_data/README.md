# Intermediate Data

## What is Intermediate Data

Intermediate assessment data is the outcome of data processing and analysis performed as part of the assessment as an intermediate step in the generation of final assessment data.

Data is only defined as intermediate if it has gone through **non-trivial processing** to be considered an **original product**, distinct from the input data. These intermediate datasets may be of high value in terms of ensuring transparency around the assessment process, as an outcome of an expert-based assessment of the underlying evidence for the report, and as a resource for users trying to replicate IPCC results or to implement policies based on the IPCC assessment findings.
