# Data Folder README

The `data/` folder contains **shared data access instructions and provenance metadata** used in this project. **This folder does not store large datasets**, but provides structured metadata and access information to ensure reproducibility and proper attribution.

All datasets referenced by figures or analyses in this project should be documented here, including any standard preprocessing applied prior to figure generation. When multiple figures rely on the same dataset or preprocessing workflow, this canonical metadata is maintained in this folder to **avoid duplication**.
