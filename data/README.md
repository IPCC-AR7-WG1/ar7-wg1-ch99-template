# Chapter-level Data Folder

When multiple figures rely on the same dataset or preprocessing workflow, this canonical metadata is maintained in this folder to **avoid duplication**.

The `data/` folder contains **shared data access instructions and provenance metadata** used in this project. This folder does **not store large datasets**, but provides structured metadata and access information to ensure reproducibility and proper attribution.
