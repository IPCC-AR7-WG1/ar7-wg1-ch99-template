# Input Data

## What is Input Data

Input data denotes the source data that underpins information in the assessment reports.

It is typically authored by credible, authoritative, trusted sources, who decide under which license it is published. 

In some instances, key datasets published under restrictive conditions can be made available to IPCC authors through special exemptions and waivers.

## Purpose of This Folder

This folder contains **documentation about input data**, NOT the data files themselves.

Input data are scientific data sources provided by third parties used to generate figures in the assessment reports.

This information is to be used for credit attribution to the data providers. 

For some types of Input Data (like CMIP7), it is also used for long-term archival in the IPCC Data Distribution Centre (DDC). 

## Machine-Readable Documentation

A machine readable template will be provided in the future to standardize the documentation of input data sources.
